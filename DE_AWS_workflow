DEworkflow.png
Here is a short description of the workflow shown in the image:

Source (Prism data in MySQL):

Prism data is stored in MySQL Workbench.

Phase 1 - Extraction:

Crawler: Scans and extracts metadata from the source (MySQL database).

Phase 2 - Data Catalog/Replica:

Data is cataloged and stored as a replica for further processing.

Phase 3 - S3 Storage:

Extracted data is stored in S3 in CSV format.

Phase 4 - Transformation:

AWS Glue: Utilizes the stored data in S3 to transform it into the desired format.

Data is processed incrementally through a pipeline.

Phase 5 - Loading to Target (Riddhi Database):

The current data, along with a timestamp, is loaded into the Riddhi Database.

Stored procedures are used to manipulate and manage the final tables in the database.

Phase 6 - Data Reporting:

Redshift: Handles data warehousing and enables querying for reporting.

Data reporting and dashboards are created.

Phase 7 - Monitoring:

The entire process is monitored through CloudWatch.

Phase 8 - Data Visualization:

Data is visualized using Power BI for reporting and dashboard creation.

This workflow represents a complete ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process, where data is extracted from the source, transformed, loaded into the target database, and then visualized for reporting.

 

Strengths:
Modular Phases:

The workflow is divided into clear phases (extraction, transformation, loading, etc.), which makes it easier to manage, monitor, and scale.

Scalability:

Using AWS Glue, S3, and Redshift allows for handling large volumes of data efficiently and can scale with increasing data sizes.

Automation:

The process involves automated components (like AWS Glue and Crawler), reducing manual intervention and human error.

Monitoring and Logging:

CloudWatch integration ensures that the entire pipeline is monitored, and any issues can be quickly identified and addressed.

Data Management:

The use of stored procedures to manage and manipulate data in the final database adds a layer of control and ensures that the data is in the desired format.

Data Visualization:

Power BI for visualization allows for comprehensive reporting and insights.

Potential Improvements:
Data Validation:

Add Validation Layers: Before loading data into the Riddhi Database, you might want to include a data validation step to ensure data quality and consistency.

Data Security:

Encryption: Ensure that data at rest in S3 and in transit between services is encrypted. Implement IAM policies carefully to restrict access to sensitive data.

Data Partitioning:

Optimize S3 Storage: Consider partitioning data in S3 based on specific criteria (e.g., date, region) to improve query performance and reduce costs when accessing data.

Error Handling:

Robust Error Handling: Include more robust error-handling mechanisms to manage any failures during the ETL process, such as retries, notifications, and detailed logging.

Pipeline Orchestration:

Consider Step Functions: If the pipeline grows more complex, consider using AWS Step Functions or a similar orchestration tool to manage the execution flow and dependencies between different stages.

Data Lineage:

Track Data Lineage: Implement a system to track data lineage, helping to understand the transformation journey of data from source to target, which is useful for debugging and audits.

Performance Tuning:

Optimize Glue Jobs: Regularly review and optimize AWS Glue jobs for performance, such as fine-tuning the number of workers and using AWS Glue job bookmarks for incremental processing.

Cost Management:

Cost Monitoring: Keep a close eye on the cost implications of using AWS services (S3, Glue, Redshift) and ensure that the resources are being used efficiently.
